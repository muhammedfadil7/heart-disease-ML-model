# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on health metrics such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more.  
Using a dataset of medical records, various machine learning models are trained and evaluated to identify the most accurate predictive approach.

## 📊 Dataset
- Contains patient health details such as:
  - Age
  - Sex
  - Chest pain type
  - Resting blood pressure
  - Serum cholesterol
  - Fasting blood sugar
  - Resting ECG results
  - Maximum heart rate achieved
  - Exercise induced angina
  - Oldpeak (ST depression)
  - Slope, number of major vessels, and thalassemia status
- Target variable: **Presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease**

## ⚙️ Steps in the Notebook
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Statistical summaries
   - Correlation analysis
   - Visualizations with Matplotlib & Seaborn

3. **Model Building**
   - Logistic Regression
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
